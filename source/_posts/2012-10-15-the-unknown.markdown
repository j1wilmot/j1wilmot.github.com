I can't pinpoint why, but being in the state of "not knowing" is uncomfortable. Most especially around other people. "Not knowing" feels like "stupid" or "dumb". But how silly is this? If we do not feel some affinity for "not knowing" perhaps we will turtle away ina small protective ball of "knowing". What an upsetting thought.

Feeling insecure about one's "knowledge" feels like a dishonesty. It is a refusal to accept oneself. Admitting that one does not "know" is a humbling acceptance of one's limits.

"Knowing" may be more dangerous than not knowing. Once something is "known" it is not tested or asked of. It is fully accepted. Perhaps nothing should ever be completely "known".

This is not meant to be a full embracing of ignorance. But perhaps an aknowldgement or acceptance of its eternal quality. The unknown will always be with us. This is the way of things. It is not something to fear.

But It seems that fear is rooted in the unknown, which makes things more difficult. For there is no fear in certainty. As mortal beings we are certain that we will die, but it is not truly death itself that is terrifying, but rather the gaping uncertainty that lurks behind it.

In some ways absolute certainty is equally troubling. Do we desire an end to uncertainty? Does curiosity search for appeasement or is curiosity it's own reward? I suppose this is not a question we need think on too deeply as uncertainty is not departing.

But where does this leave us?
